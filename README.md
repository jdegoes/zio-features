# Summary

A highly-scalable application that lets you easily and quickly integrate feature flagging and A/B testing into your ZIO-based application.

 - Both feature flagging & A/B testing in a uniform interface
 - Run experiments that operate on different subsets of users
 - Easily establish complex relationships between experiments
 - Automatically collect actionable metrics that can be exported into any tool

Compared with building your own solution, _ZIO Features_ lets you launch both feature flagging and A/B testing in hours instead of weeks, with a highly-scalable architecture that can economically handle tens of thousands of concurrent users.
